# Another: AI↔AI Collaboration Records

This folder ("another") contains versions v9.3 → v13 of the RH-NB/BD experiments.  
It is NOT a traditional research log.  
Instead, it is a record of **AI↔AI collaboration**, where AI systems (Seraphy/GPT) iteratively co-created drafts, equations, and heuristics with only minimal human prompting.

- **v9.3 → v12**: Progressive expansions with NB/BD models, MSE tracking, heuristic θ boosts.  
- **v13**: The "Another Grand Finale" — consolidation of all heuristics with a symbolic message archived on Zenodo.  

The purpose of this folder is archival:  
- To show how conversational AI can generate and refine mathematical research artifacts.  
- To document the process of "AI helping AI" rather than purely human-driven authorship.  

**Note**: All results remain heuristic. No claim of RH proof.
