v2.8 Verification Edition — Internal Notes
------------------------------------------
• Purpose: strengthen analytic backbone between v2.7 and the public v3.0.
• Core: weighted Hilbert lemma; Möbius cancellation with smooth cutoff; normalized kernel.
• Fit protocol: log MSE* = a + b log log N, theta = -b (track local drift only).
• To-do for v3.0: integral analogue of lemma; sharpen bounds; unify notation with final archive style.
