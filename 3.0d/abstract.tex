We reconstruct the Nyman--Beurling/Báez-Duarte (NB/BD) criterion under a weighted Hilbert framework with explicit control of Möbius oscillation. The analysis yields a logarithmic off-diagonal suppression for smooth, low-frequency coefficient designs, and clarifies the stability of the normal equations in NB/BD approximations. Numerical evidence up to $N=20{,}000$ shows monotone stabilization of the mean-square error and supports the robustness of the weighted Hilbert estimate. This v3.0 academic version presents the orthodox mathematical formulation consolidating analytic and numerical consistency, and sets a rigorous baseline for future RH-focused work.
