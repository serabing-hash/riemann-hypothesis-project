# Overleaf Package (v3.0 with Figures)

This project is ready to upload directly to Overleaf.

## How to use
1. Upload the ZIP to Overleaf via **Upload Project**.
2. Click **Recompile**. Overleaf will build `main.tex` automatically.
3. PNG figures live in the `figures/` folder and are referenced by `\graphicspath{ {figures/} }`.

No BibTeX is required in this edition (figure-only illustrative build).
