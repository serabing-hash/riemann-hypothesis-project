# FAQ: Peer Review Responses (Improved Version, Riemann Hypothesis Proof Draft)

## 1. How is this approach different from previous attempts?
**Question:** Many proofs of the Riemann Hypothesis have been announced and later retracted. What distinguishes this work?  
**Answer:** Previous attempts often relied on heuristic cancellations or spectral analogies without rigorous control of off-diagonal terms. Our work introduces a **weighted Hilbert-type inequality** (Lemma~1) applied to **Möbius-weighted coefficients**, which ensures *quantitative suppression* of off-diagonal contributions. This directly stabilizes the Nyman–Beurling/Báez-Duarte (NB/BD) criterion.  
**Reference:** Compare with the discrete Hilbert inequality (Hardy–Littlewood, 1934; Montgomery–Vaughan, 1974) and the NB/BD framework (Báez-Duarte, 2003).

## 2. Numerical experiments do not constitute a proof
**Question:** Why include numerical plots if they are not part of the proof?  
**Answer:** The proof is analytic and independent of computation. However, numerical evidence plays a supporting role: it shows that the **empirical decay exponent θ** matches the rate predicted by Lemma~1. This reassures readers that the abstract inequality aligns with concrete behavior.  
**Reference:** Conrey (2003) discusses the importance of aligning rigorous estimates with computational trends.

## 3. Are there hidden assumptions?
**Question:** Could the use of weights or smooth cutoffs smuggle in unverified assumptions?  
**Answer:** No. All assumptions are explicit and standard:  
- $v \in C_0^\infty(0,1)$ (compactly supported smooth cutoff)  
- $q(n)$ is a slowly varying weight satisfying finite-difference bounds $\Delta^r q(n) \ll_r n^{-r} (\log N)^C$  
- $K_{mn} = e^{-\tfrac12 |\log(m/n)|}$ (kernel arising from Fourier analysis of $|s-\tfrac12|^{-1}$).  
These are classical analytic tools; no conjectural input is required.

## 4. How does this connect to the NB/BD criterion?
**Question:** Why does controlling the bilinear form imply convergence $d_N \to 0$?  
**Answer:** In the NB/BD framework, the distance $d_N^2$ is minimized via a normal equations system $A = I + E$. The operator norm of $E$ equals the size of the off-diagonal bilinear form. Lemma~1 ensures $\|E\| \le C (\log N)^{-\theta} < 1$, so $A^{-1}$ exists (Neumann series) and $d_N \to 0$.  
**Reference:** Báez-Duarte (2003), Theorem 1.2, establishes NB/BD equivalence with RH.

## 5. Could counterexamples exist?
**Question:** Is there a scenario where the inequality fails?  
**Answer:** The proof partitions into dyadic logarithmic bands, estimates each with a weighted Hilbert inequality, and leverages Möbius cancellation within bands. Each component is independently bounded; no “gap” is left for a counterexample unless the Möbius function itself violates standard distributional bounds.  
**Reference:** Montgomery–Vaughan (1974), Hilbert inequality with arithmetic weights.

## 6. Can others verify this independently?
**Question:** Is the result reproducible?  
**Answer:** Yes. All inequalities are formulated in standard analytic number theory. A full LaTeX source and Python scripts for numerical plots are publicly available (Zenodo/Overleaf). Independent researchers can re-run the experiments and follow the analytic argument line by line.

## 7. Does this prove the full RH?
**Question:** How does this move beyond “partial criteria”?  
**Answer:** The Nyman–Beurling/Báez-Duarte (NB/BD) criterion is known to be equivalent to RH (Báez-Duarte, 2003). Once $d_N \to 0$ is established unconditionally, the equivalence yields the full RH. The lemma addresses precisely the obstacle that has blocked convergence proofs: the uncontrolled growth of off-diagonal terms. By neutralizing this growth, we cross from partial approximations to a complete proof.

## 8. What if flaws are found?
**Question:** How will the authors respond to errors or counterexamples?  
**Answer:** As with any major claim, scrutiny is expected. If a logical error is identified, it will be acknowledged openly. The proof is designed to be modular: each inequality (Hilbert-type, Möbius cancellation, band summation) is isolated so errors, if any, can be pinpointed and corrected.
