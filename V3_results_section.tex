\section{Numerical Results for V3}
We performed a sweep over parameters $(\lambda,\rho)$ for $N \in \{200,500,800,1000\}$. 
The diagonal--main term $M$ was negative in all tested cases, confirming stability of the 
sign flip achieved in Version~2. However, the off-diagonal suppression ratio 
$\mathrm{ratio}=E_{\mathrm{off}}/\sum |a_n|^2$ remained at the $0.8$--$0.9$ level, 
which is substantially larger than the target bound $1/\log N \approx 0.15$--$0.18$. 
Thus further refinement of the basis or weighting is required to achieve logarithmic suppression.

Table~\ref{tab:v3_summary} summarizes the observed averages.
