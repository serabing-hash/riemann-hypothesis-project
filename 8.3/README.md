# NB/BD Project v10.0 Package (Fixed)

**What's new**
- Functional equation $\xi(s)=\xi(1-s)$ integrated with NB/BD.
- Zero-free region + Hilbert lemma â‡’ contradiction skeleton for off-critical zeros.
- Numerical table up to N=20k, prelim N=100k; figure included.

**Files**
- main_v10.tex
- figures/v10_scaling.png
- results/v10_results.csv
- README.md

**Note**: This is not a proof of RH; further $\epsilon$--$\delta$ bounds and analytic control are needed.
