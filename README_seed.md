# Seed Summary: Riemann Hypothesis Exploration

This package compresses the main insights (V1–V5) into a single seed document.

## Achievements
- Negative main–diag across N.
- Off–diag suppression at 1/log N scale (V4).
- Uniformity up to N=2000 (even over-suppression).
- Proof roadmap (V5) with NB/BD alignment and residual control.

## Limitations
- Admissibility of basis not proven in NB/BD frame.
- Uniform constants not established.
- Residual terms uncontrolled.
- Final chain to RH equivalence not closed.

## Purpose
This is a **seed**: a concise trace left for future researchers.  
It demonstrates a structural path that may evolve into a proof.
