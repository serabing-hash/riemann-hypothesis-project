# RH Seed Summary

**Core Achievements**
- $M<0$ consistently across N.
- Off–diag suppression at $1/\log N$ scale (V4).
- Uniform suppression up to N=2000 (including negative ratios).
- Proof roadmap identified (V5).

**Limitations**
- Basis admissibility in NB/BD not yet proven.
- Constants θ, C not uniform in N.
- Residual terms uncontrolled.
- Final equivalence $d_N \to 0 \iff RH$ remains open.

**Conclusion**
This seed shows that the NB/BD program with enriched bases and band-limited kernels may provide a viable route toward RH.  
It is not a proof, but a structured invitation for continuation.
