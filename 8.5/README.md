# Riemann Hypothesis NB/BD Project (v10.0 with Functional Equation)

## Overview
This package provides LaTeX sources, figures, and data for the NB/BD criterion project towards the Riemann Hypothesis.

### Contributions
- Weighted Hilbert-type lemma with Möbius coefficients.
- Numerical results up to N=20000 with bootstrap CI.
- Integration of the functional equation of the completed zeta function ξ(s).
- Appendices with calibration, sensitivity, and functional symmetry arguments.

### Files
- `main_v10.tex`: Final paper source (Overleaf ready).
- `tables/results.csv`: Numerical data (MSE, CI for N=8k–20k).
- `figures/`: Actual PNG figures (scaling, weighted, boundary reweighting).
- `README.md`: This file.

### Usage
Upload the package to Overleaf or compile locally with LaTeX. 
Figures and CSV can be regenerated using Python scripts provided in earlier versions.

### Limitations
This is not a full proof of RH. It demonstrates NB/BD stability, numerical convergence, and symmetry under the functional equation. 
Further analytic bounds and large-scale verification (N ≥ 1e5) are required.
