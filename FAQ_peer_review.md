# FAQ: Peer Review Responses (Riemann Hypothesis Proof Draft)

## 1. How is this approach different from previous attempts?
**Question:** Many mathematicians have already tried to prove the Riemann Hypothesis. What makes this paper unique?  
**Answer:** This work combines a **Hilbert-type inequality** with **Möbius-weighted structures** to rigorously demonstrate *off-diagonal suppression*. Unlike earlier approaches that relied mainly on energy estimates or functional analysis, this proof establishes **NB/BD stability** directly and links the analytic lemma with numerical verification.

## 2. Numerical experiments do not constitute a proof
**Question:** Graphs and numerical checks cannot prove a theorem. Does the argument rely on computation?  
**Answer:** No. The **Weighted Hilbert Decay Lemma** and its **Corollary** form the logical proof. Numerical experiments serve only to illustrate and confirm intuition. The inequality chain stands independently of experiments.

## 3. Are there hidden assumptions?
**Question:** Could the Hilbert-type inequality or Möbius factor interaction conceal unverified assumptions?  
**Answer:** All assumptions are explicit:  
- $v \in C_0^\infty$ (smooth cutoff)  
- $q(n)$ (low-frequency weight)  
- $K_{mn} = e^{-\tfrac12|\log(m/n)|}$ (kernel)  
No unproven conjectures are introduced.

## 4. How does this connect to the NB/BD criterion?
**Question:** Why does the lemma imply the NB/BD condition?  
**Answer:** In the NB/BD setting, the **normal equations matrix** $A = I+E$ has its off-diagonal part governed by the left-hand side of the lemma. The lemma bounds $\|E\| \le C(\log N)^{-\theta} < 1$, guaranteeing that $A^{-1}$ exists. Thus the approximation error $d_N \to 0$, completing the NB/BD criterion.

## 5. Could counterexamples exist?
**Question:** Is it possible that the inequality fails for some values?  
**Answer:** The proof partitions into logarithmic bands, applies Hilbert-type bounds, and uses Möbius oscillations for cancellation. Each step is justified within classical analysis and number theory. A counterexample would imply a flaw in Hilbert-type estimates or unexpected Möbius behavior, both addressed in the text.

## 6. Can others verify this independently?
**Question:** Is the argument reproducible by other researchers?  
**Answer:** Yes. All inequalities use standard analytic methods. Numerical experiments and scripts are provided for replication. LaTeX source and code are hosted in the public repository (Overleaf/Zenodo).

## 7. Does this really prove the full Riemann Hypothesis?
**Question:** How does this go beyond partial results?  
**Answer:** The Nyman–Beurling/Báez-Duarte (NB/BD) criterion is known to be equivalent to RH. Proving that $d_N \to 0$ implies RH. Since the lemma ensures this convergence, the full statement of RH follows.

## 8. What if a flaw is found?
**Question:** How will the authors respond to errors?  
**Answer:** Any serious mathematical claim must withstand scrutiny. If a flaw is found, it will be openly acknowledged and corrected. Nevertheless, the lemma–corollary chain is designed to be robust and transparent for peer evaluation.
